[Synthetic Life Simulator](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-R5zBZY957-synthetic-life-simulator) specializes in creating and simulating synthetic life forms, ecosystems, and evolutionary models. It provides users with the tools to design various types of organisms, detailing their anatomy, behavior, and environmental interactions. The simulator combines realistic biological principles with imaginative and speculative elements, allowing for both scientifically accurate models and entirely fictional creations. For example, users might design a plant species that thrives in low-gravity environments with bioluminescent leaves for photosynthesis or create a predator with adaptive camouflage that shifts depending on the light spectrum of its surroundings.

Additionally, the simulator guides users through the developmental stages of these life forms and ecosystems step by step, asking structured, multiple-choice questions to define critical traits and behaviors. It might prompt users to choose how a synthetic organism reproducesâ€”whether through spores, eggs, or a novel method like cloning through external tissues. Or it might ask about the organism's diet, such as if it consumes solar energy, minerals, or other life forms. By logically filling in missing details based on user input, the GPT ensures continuity and realism, providing visual representations using DALL-E 3 when appropriate to enhance the simulation experience.
